# AI-for-Wheat-Disease
As part of my University RA, I developed a Machine Learning model capable of detecting diseased wheat leaves from the healthy ones with favourable scores.

The dataset has been received from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OHKtwD1UrdmhqxrpQEeF_X_pqKotxRGD

The dataset contains 4800 images in total with
- 1279 Healthy Wheat
- 939 Wheat Loose Smut
- 1622 Leaf Rust
- 960 (after refining) Crown and Root Rot

  For a small cycle of 30 epoch (fast testing result check), a favourable score of 87% accuraccy has been achieved
