# AI-for-Wheat-Disease
As part of my University RA, I developed a Deep Learning model capable of detecting diseased wheat leaves amongst the healthy ones with favourable scores.

The dataset has been received from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OHKtwD1UrdmhqxrpQEeF_X_pqKotxRGD

The dataset contains 4800 images in total with
- 1279 Healthy Wheat
- 939 Wheat Loose Smut
- 1622 Leaf Rust
- 960 (after refining) Crown and Root Rot

A new type of technique has been utilised (by browsing multiple sources) of classifying each type of plant image into a binary array (4 arrays used) for a favourable and easy classification portrayal alongside using Neural Networks.

For a small cycle of 30 epochs only (faster model result check), a favourable score of 87.31% accuracy has been achieved.

A paper has also been put forth to publish using the results derived from this programme.
